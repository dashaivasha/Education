Project Description:
The project available on this GitHub repository is focused on testing the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ using C#. The project includes various test scenarios that have been written using the NUnit framework to send HTTP requests and validate responses received from the API endpoints.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to verify the functionality and reliability of the JSONPlaceholderTypicode through a series of automated tests. By ensuring that the API is functioning as expected, the project aims to improve the quality and usability of applications that rely on this API.

Problem it Solves:
Developers need to ensure that the API endpoints they utilize are working correctly and return accurate data. However, it can be time-consuming and tedious to manually test each endpoint, especially as the number of endpoints increases. This project solves this problem by automating the testing process and providing a way to quickly and easily validate the functionality of the API endpoints.
