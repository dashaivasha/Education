Project Description:
The project available on this GitHub repository focuses on testing the VK (VKontakte) API using C#. The project includes various test scripts written using the NUnit framework to test the functionality and reliability of the VK API endpoints. The VK API documentation was ileoed, as well as the function of sending photos to the server and checking for publication, liking and publishing comments and photos on the user's wall was tested.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to automate the VK API testing process by creating a set of unit tests that verify the correct behavior of the API endpoints. Using automated tests, the project aims to improve the quality and usability of applications that rely on the VK API.

The problem it solves:
I needed to make sure that the API endpoints they were using were working correctly and returning accurate data.  Overall, the project aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of VK API testing by providing a set of automated tests that can be easily run and maintained. The use of the NUnit framework and the C# programming language makes the project easily adaptable to other projects that require API testing.
