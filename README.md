Project Description:
The project available on this GitHub repository is dedicated to testing the https://userinyerface.com/ site using the C# programming language and the Selenium WebDriver API. The project includes various test scripts that test the functionality and reliability of the GUI and elements of the UserInyerface site. 

Objective:
The goal of this project is to automate the UserInyerface site testing process by creating a set of end-to-end tests that verify the correct behavior of the GUI and site elements. Through automated tests, the project aims to improve the quality and usability of the UserInyerface site. Entry forms, user avatar loading, and the handling of pop-up site elements were tested. Also, the tests are written with minimal execution time, as the site is implemented a timer for data entry

The problem it solves:
It was necessary to make sure that the website works correctly and provide a good user experience, to test the functionality and usability of the graphical interface and elements of the site UserInyerface.
The site also has a timer, which complicates the testing process, but the project includes testing scripts that take this feature into account.
